Spglib
------

Spglib is a C library for finding and handling crystal symmetries.

`Spglib-1.7.4
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/spglib/files/spglib/spglib-1.7/>`_. is
the stable release.

`Spglib-1.8
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/spglib/files/spglib/spglib-1.8/>`_
is the latest release. This version is expected to be slightly faster
and compact, and the code is cleaner to be the base of future
development.

version on history in `ChangeLog
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/blob/master/ChangeLog>`_.



Features
^^^^^^^^

* Find symmetry operations
* Identify space-group type
* Wyckoff position assignment
* Refine crystal structure
* Find a primitive cell
* Search irreducible k-points
* Liner tetrahedron method (the document is to be prepared.)

Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Space-group type finding algorithm: R. W. Grosse-Kunstleve, Acta
  Cryst., A55, 383-395 (1999)

* Crystal refinement algorithm: R. W. Grosse-Kunstleve and
  P. D. Adams, Acta Cryst., A58, 60-65 (2002)

Install
^^^^^^^

1. `Download spglib
   <https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=215020>`_.

2. Unzip, configure, and make::

   % tar xvfz spglib-1.7.4.tar.gz
   % cd spglib-1.7.4
   % ./configure
   % make

3. Copy the libraries where you want using OpenMP. The libraries may
   be in ``src/.libs`` if you don't ``make install``,

OpenMP
~~~~~~

Bottle neck of symmetry operation search may be eased using the OpenMP
threading. In the case of gcc (> 4.2), set the following environment
variables before running configure script::

   % export LIBS='-lgomp'
   % export CFLAGS='-fopenmp'

Overhead of threading is relatively large when the number of atoms is
small. Therefore the threading is activated when the number of atoms
>= 1000.

Usage
^^^^^

1. Include ``spglib.h``
2. Link ``libsymspg.a`` or ``libsymspg.so``
3. Examples are shown in ``example.c``.

Example
^^^^^^^

A few examples are stored in ``example`` directory. The fortran
interface 

Testing
^^^^^^^

The ruby code ``symPoscar.rb`` in ``test`` directory reads a VASP
POSCAR formatted file and finds the space-group type. The ``-l``
option refines a slightly distorted structure within tolerance
spacified with the ``-s`` option. The ``-o`` option gives the symmetry
operations of the input structure.

::

   ruby symPoscar.rb POSCAR -s 0.1 -o -l


How to compile is found in the README file.

Python extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python extension for ASE is prepared in the ``python/ase`` directory.
See http://spglib.sourceforge.net/pyspglibForASE/

Fortran interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fortran interface ``spglib_f08.f90`` is found in ``example``
directory. This fortran interface is the contribution from Dimitar
Pashov. ``spglib_f.c`` is obsolete and is not recommended to use.
