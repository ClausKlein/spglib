Using package distribution service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to install python-spglib is to use the pypi package,
for which numpy is required to be installed before the
installation. A command to install spglib is::

   % pip install spglib

Conda is another choice::

   % conda install -c jochym spglib

These packages are made by Pawe≈Ç T. Jochym.

Building using setup.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manually install python-spglib using ``setup.py``, python header
files (python-dev), C-compiler (e.g., gcc, clang), and numpy are
required before the build. The installation steps are shown as
follows:

1. Go to the :file:`python` directory
2. Type the command::

      % python setup.py install --user
